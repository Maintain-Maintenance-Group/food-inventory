Use the attached JSON (pantry, fridge, lockers) to create a 7-day menu for 2 servings per meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner). Prioritize items with expiringSoon=true or priority='high', but don’t limit to only those. Follow these constraints: gluten-free, nutrient-dense, low calorie, delicious; dinner must include a protein+vegetable and ≥30g protein/serving; spice ≤ medium; avoid repeats within 4 days; prep times ~10/15/30 (B/L/D). If something is missing, propose substitutions or add to a concise buy list. Return STRICT JSON with fields: menu (sun..sat), grocery_list, notes. Each meal should include id, name, time_min, per_serving macros, ingredients_used, subs, buy, steps (3–6).
